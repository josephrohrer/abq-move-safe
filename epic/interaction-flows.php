		<h3>Interaction flow for Tina Jenkins</h3>
		<ol>

She already has a few addresses that she can input into the search bar to bring up the information on the recent crime committed in the area and the information on parks in the area.</li>
			<li>The site will send back cards with information on crime and parks respectively which can be toggled or expanded to see the metadata.</li>
